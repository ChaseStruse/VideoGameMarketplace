# Video Game Marketplace

This is my second blockchain application, ever!!! I am attempting to iterate on my prior project, EtherMarketplace, and make this project even better.
For this project I am not using tutorials and am purely going based on the documentation. I am learning and failing all by myself. 

## Requirements to run
- Truffle
- npm 
- Ganache
- Metamask

## How to run

1. Start Ganache and create a new workspace
2. Within your browser, go to metamask, connect to local Ganache instance
3. Import two accounts from Ganache to your metamask
    - 1 should be the seller
    - 2 Should be the buyer
4. Within the console, run truffle compile
5. Run truffle migrate
6. Run npm install
7. Run npm run start
8. Once the browser opens, connect your metamask account for the seller

## Issues that may come up later or will need refactoring

- I feel like there needs to be a better way to deal with the product storage... not sure how yet but still thinking.
